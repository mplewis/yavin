  A Message From the CEO

  Dear Fellow Member‚
  We know the COVID‐19 pandemic is having a financial impact, and we're taking action to ease the burden. Every member with an auto insurance policy in effect as of March 31, 2020, will receive a 20% credit on two months of premiums in the coming weeks. All told, we're returning about $520 million.
  We're able to pass on those savings because your efforts to stay home during the pandemic have meant fewer drivers on the road, which means fewer accidents and claims.
  You will receive a credit applied to your bill. There is no need to call or take any action. For more details on the premium credit, please click here.
  This is your association and we remain strong thanks to your service and loyalty. As a result, we are able to share our financial strength by giving back each year and in times of need. In 2019, we returned almost $2.4 billion in the form of distributions, dividends, and bank rebates and rewards. This credit is one of the many ways we're helping members deal with the pandemic's financial impacts, from offering special payment assistance to waiving late fees. You can learn more about other ways we can help at usaa.com/coronavirus.
  Thank you for doing your part to keep our communities safe during this crisis, whether you're serving on the front lines of the pandemic or staying at home.
  Our mission is to serve you and your family. It has been USAA's North Star since our founding in 1922.
  Respectfully‚
  Wayne Peacock
